==============================

This readme.md is for the Repository for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The main scrip file is called:
### run_analysis.R

When sourced, the script, 
1. Installs all necessary packages and installs all necessary libraries
2. Downloads data set from internet and unzips the file in a new directory
3. Reads in the test activity, subject, and features files
4. Reads in the training activity, subject, and features files
5. Combines (or Merges) the test and training data into one data set.
6. Assigns Label names to all the columns
7. Extracts only mean and standard deviations for each measurement
8. create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
